## Description
Using the OpenWeather API I created a weather dashboard. This dashboard shows the current weather of the inputted city, as well as a five day forecast. It uses localStorage to store persistent data so the user can easily see their previous searches, and view the weather without having to enter the city again.

## Installation
To install this, you can clone the code from this GitHub repository, or simply use the site via the link to the live application.

## Usage
After navigating to the site, simply type in the name of the city you would like to view the weather for, and click 'search'. Then, you will see the current and future weather for that city on the right. You will also see that a button has been dynamically generated below the previous searches area, allowing you to click the button for a faster future search of that city.
